HISTORY

WinBoard is a port of the Unix program XBoard to Win32,
the 32-bit Microsoft Windows API.  The graphical front
end (WinBoard.c, etc.) is all new, but the back end
that understands chess rules, chess notation, GNU
Chess, the ICS, etc., is shared with XBoard.  See
WinBoard.hlp for a list of contributors to WinBoard and
XBoard.
