@node Major modes
@chapter Major modes
@cindex Major modes

XBoard always runs in one of four major modes.  You select the
major mode from the command line when you start up XBoard.

@table @asis
@item xboard [options]
As an interface to GNU Chess or another chess engine running on your
machine, XBoard lets you play a game against the machine,
set up arbitrary positions, force variations, watch a game between two
chess engines, interactively analyze your stored games or set up and
analyze arbitrary positions.  (Note: Not all chess engines support
analysis.)
@item xboard -ics -icshost hostname [options]
As Internet Chess Server (ICS) interface, XBoard
lets you play against other ICS users, observe games
they are playing, or review games that have recently finished.  Most
of the ICS "wild" chess variants are supported, including bughouse.
@item xboard -ncp [options]
XBoard can also be used simply
as an electronic chessboard to play through games. It will read and
write game files and allow you to play through variations
manually. You can use it to browse games off the net or review games
you have saved.  These features are also available in the other modes.
@item |pxboard
If you want to pipe games into XBoard, use the supplied shell
script @file{pxboard}.  For example, from the news reader @file{xrn},
find a message with one or more games in it, click the Save button,
and type @samp{|pxboard} as the file name.
@item cmail [options]
As an interface to electronic mail correspondence chess, XBoard
works with the cmail program. See @ref{CMail} below for
instructions.
@end table

@node Menus
@chapter Menus, buttons, and keys
@cindex Menus

To move a piece, you can drag it with the left mouse button, or you
can click the left mouse button once on the piece, then once more on
the destination square.  To drop a new piece on a square (when
applicable), press the middle or the right mouse button over the
square and select from the popup menu.  In cases where you can drop
either a white or black piece, use the middle button (or shift+right)
for white and the right button (or shift+middle) for black.  When you
are playing a bughouse game on an Internet Chess Server, a list of the
offboard pieces that each player has available is shown in the window
title after the player's name; in addition, the piece menus show the
number of pieces available of each type.

All other XBoard commands are available from the menu bar. The most
frequently used commands also have shortcut keys or on-screen buttons.

When XBoard is iconized, its graphical icon is a white knight if
it is White's turn to move, a black knight if it is Black's turn.  See
Iconize in @ref{Keys} below if you have problems getting this
feature to work.

@menu
* File Menu::       Accessing external games and positions.
* Mode Menu::       Selecting XBoard's mode.
* Action Menu::     Talking to the chess engine or ICS opponents.
* Step Menu::       Controlling the game.
* Options Menu::    User preferences.
* Help Menu::       Getting help.
* Keys::            Other shortcut keys.
@end menu

@node File Menu
@section File Menu
@cindex File Menu
@cindex Menu, File
@table @asis
@item Reset
@cindex Reset, Menu Item
Resets XBoard and the chess engine to the beginning of a new chess
game. The @kbd{r} key is a keyboard equivalent. In Internet Chess
Server mode, clears the current state of XBoard, then
resynchronizes with the ICS by sending a refresh command. If you want to
stop playing, observing, or examining an ICS game, use an
appropriate command from the Action menu, not @samp{Reset}.
@xref{Action Menu}.
@item Load Game
@cindex Load Game, Menu Item
Plays a game from a record file. The @kbd{g} key is a keyboard equivalent.
A popup dialog prompts you for the file name. If the file contains more
than one game, a second popup dialog
displays a list of games (with information drawn from their PGN tags, if
any), and you can select the one you want. Alternatively, you can load the
Nth game in the file directly, by typing the number @kbd{N} after the
file name, separated by a space.

The game file parser will accept PGN (portable game notation),
or in fact almost any file that contains moves in algebraic
notation. 
Notation of the form @samp{P@@f7}
is accepted for piece-drops in bughouse games;
this is a nonstandard extension to PGN.
If the file includes a PGN position (FEN tag), or an old-style
XBoard position diagram bracketed by @samp{[--} and @samp{--]}
before the first move, the game starts from that position. Text
enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, or curly braces is assumed to
be commentary and is displayed in a pop-up window. Any other
text in the file is ignored. PGN variations (enclosed in
parentheses) are treated as comments; XBoard is not able to walk
variation trees.
The nonstandard PGN tag [Variant "varname"] functions similarly to
the -variant command-line option (see below), allowing games in certain chess
variants to be loaded.  There is also a heuristic to 
recognize chess variants from the Event tag, by looking for the strings
that the Internet Chess Servers put there when saving variant ("wild") games.
@item Load Next Game
@cindex Load Next Game, Menu Item
Loads the next game from the last game record file you loaded.
The shifted @kbd{N} key is a keyboard equivalent.
@item Load Previous Game
@cindex Load Previous Game, Menu Item
Loads the previous game from the last game record file you
loaded.  The shifted @kbd{P} key is a keyboard equivalent.
Not available if the last game was loaded from a pipe.
@item Reload Same Game
@cindex Reload Same Game, Menu Item
Reloads the last game you loaded.
Not available if the last game was loaded from a pipe.
@item Save Game
@cindex Save Game, Menu Item
Appends a record of the current game to a file.
A popup dialog
prompts you for the file name. If the game did not begin with
the standard starting position, the game file includes the
starting position used. Games are saved in the PGN (portable
game notation) format, unless the oldSaveStyle option is true,
in which case they are saved in an older format that is specific
to XBoard. Both formats are human-readable, and both can be
read back by the @samp{Load Game} command.
Notation of the form @samp{P@@f7}
is accepted for piece-drops in bughouse games;
this is a nonstandard extension to PGN.
@item Copy Game
@cindex Copy Game, Menu Item
Copies a record of the current game to an internal clipboard in PGN
format and sets the X selection to the game text.  The game can be
pasted to another application (such as a text editor or another copy
of XBoard) using that application's paste command.  In many X
applications, such as xterm and emacs, the middle mouse button can be
used for pasting; in XBoard, you must use the Paste Game command.
@item Paste Game
@cindex Paste Game, Menu Item
Interprets the current X selection as a game record and loads it, as
with Load Game.
@item Load Position
@cindex Load Position, Menu Item
Sets up a position from a position file.  A popup dialog prompts
you for the file name. If the file contains more than one saved
position, and you want to load the Nth one, type the number N
after the file name, separated by a space. Position files must
be in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation), or in the format that the
Save Position command writes when oldSaveStyle is turned on.
@item Load Next Position
@cindex Load Next Position, Menu Item
Loads the next position from the last position file you loaded.
@item Load Previous Position
@cindex Load Previous Position, Menu Item
Loads the previous position from the last position file you
loaded.  Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe.
@item Reload Same Position
@cindex Reload Same Position, Menu Item
Reloads the last position you loaded.
Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe.
@item Save Position
@cindex Save Game, Menu Item
Appends a diagram of the current position to a file.
A popup dialog
prompts you for the file name. Positions are saved in
FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation) format unless the @code{oldSaveStyle}
option is true, in which case they are saved in an older,
human-readable format that is specific to XBoard. Both formats
can be read back by the @samp{Load Position} command.
@item Copy Position
@cindex Copy Position, Menu Item
Copies the current position to an internal clipboard in FEN format and
sets the X selection to the position text.  The position can be pasted
to another application (such as a text editor or another copy of
XBoard) using that application's paste command.  In many X
applications, such as xterm and emacs, the middle mouse button can be
used for pasting; in XBoard, you must use the Paste Position command.
@item Paste Position
@cindex Paste Position, Menu Item
Interprets the current X selection as a FEN position and loads it, as
with Load Position.
@item Mail Move
@itemx Reload CMail Message
@cindex Mail Move, Menu Item
@cindex Reload CMail Message, Menu Item
See @ref{CMail}.
@item Exit
@cindex Exit, Menu Item
Exits from XBoard. The shifted @kbd{Q} key is a keyboard equivalent.
@end table

@node Mode Menu
@section Mode Menu
@cindex Menu, Mode
@cindex Mode Menu
@table @asis
@item Machine White
@cindex Machine White, Menu Item
Tells the chess engine to play White.
@item Machine Black
@cindex Machine Black, Menu Item
Tells the chess engine to play Black.
@item Two Machines
@cindex Two Machines, Menu Item
Plays a game between two chess engines.
@item Analysis Mode
@cindex Analysis Mode, Menu Item
XBoard tells the chess engine to start analyzing the current game/position
and shows you the analysis as you move pieces around.
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode.

To set up a position to analyze, you do the following:

1. Select Edit Position from the Mode Menu

2. Set up the position.  Use the middle and right buttons to
bring up the white and black piece menus.

3. When you are finished, click on either the Black or White
clock to tell XBoard which side moves first.

4. Select Analysis Mode from the Mode Menu to start the analysis.
@item Analyze File
@cindex Analyze File, Menu Item
This option lets you load a game from a file (PGN, XBoard format, etc.)
and analyze it. When you select this menu item, a popup window appears
and asks for a filename to load.
If the file contains multiple games, another popup appears that lets
you select which game you wish to analyze.
After a game is loaded, use the XBoard arrow buttons to step
forwards/backwards through the game and watch the analysis.
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode.
@item ICS Client
@cindex ICS Client, Menu Item
This is the normal mode when XBoard
is connected to a chess server.  If you have moved into
Edit Game or Edit Position mode, you can select this option to get out.

To use xboard in ICS mode, run it in the foreground with the -ics
option, and use the terminal you started it from to type commands and
receive text responses from the chess server.  See
@ref{Chess Servers} below for more information.

XBoard activates some special position/game editing features when you
use the @kbd{examine} or @kbd{bsetup} commands on ICS and you have
@samp{ICS Client} selected on the Mode menu.  First, you can issue the
ICS position-editing commands with the mouse.  Move pieces by dragging
with mouse button 1.  To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse
button 2 or 3 over the square.  This brings up a menu of white pieces
(button 2) or black pieces (button 3).  Additional menu choices let
you empty the square or clear the board.  Click on the White or Black
clock to set the side to play.  You cannot set the side to play or
drag pieces to arbitrary squares while examining on ICC, but you can
do so in @kbd{bsetup} mode on FICS.  In addition, the menu commands
@samp{Forward}, @samp{Backward}, @samp{Pause}, and @samp{Stop Examining}
have special functions in this mode; see below.
@item Edit Game
@cindex Edit Game, Menu Item
Allows you to make moves for both Black and White, and to change
moves after backing up with the @samp{Backward} command. The clocks do
not run.

In chess engine mode, the chess engine continues to check moves for legality
but does not participate in the game. You can bring the chess engine
into the game by selecting @samp{Machine White}, @samp{Machine Black},
or @samp{Two Machines}.

In ICS mode, the moves are not sent to the ICS: @samp{Edit Game} takes
XBoard out of ICS Client mode and lets you edit games locally.
If you want to edit games on ICS in a way that other ICS users
can see, use the ICS @kbd{examine} command or start an ICS match
against yourself.
@item Edit Position
@cindex Edit Position, Menu Item
Lets you set up an arbitrary board position.
Use mouse button 1 to drag pieces to new squares, or to delete a piece
by dragging it off the board or dragging an empty square on top of it.
To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3 over the
square. This brings up a menu of white pieces (button 2) or
black pieces (button 3). Additional menu choices let you empty the
square or clear the board. You can set the side to play next by
clicking on the word White or Black at the top of the screen.
Selecting @samp{Edit Position} causes XBoard to discard
all remembered moves in the current game.

In ICS mode, changes made to the position by @samp{Edit Position} are
not sent to the ICS: @samp{Edit Position} takes XBoard out of
@samp{ICS Client} mode and lets you edit positions locally. If you want to
edit positions on ICS in a way that other ICS users can see, use
the ICS @kbd{examine} command, or start an ICS match against yourself.
(See also the ICS Client topic above.)
@item Training
@cindex Training, Menu Item
Training mode lets you interactively guess the moves of a game for one
of the players. You guess the next move of the game by playing the
move on the board. If the move played matches the next move of the
game, the move is accepted and the opponent's response is autoplayed.
If the move played is incorrect, an error message is displayed.  You
can select this mode only while loading a game (that is, after
selecting @samp{Load Game} from the File menu).  While XBoard is in 
@samp{Training} mode, the navigation buttons are disabled.
@item Show Game List
@cindex Show Game List, Menu Item
Shows or hides the list of games generated by the last @samp{Load Game}
command.
@item Edit Tags
@cindex Edit Tags, Menu Item
Lets you edit the PGN (portable game notation)
tags for the current game. After editing, the tags must still conform to
the PGN tag syntax:

@example
<tag-section> ::= <tag-pair> <tag-section>
                        <empty>
<tag-pair> ::= [ <tag-name> <tag-value> ]
<tag-name> ::= <identifier>
<tag-value> ::= <string>
@end example
@noindent
See the PGN Standard for full details. Here is an example:

@example
[Event "Portoroz Interzonal"]
[Site "Portoroz, Yugoslavia"]
[Date "1958.08.16"]
[Round "8"]
[White "Robert J. Fischer"]
[Black "Bent Larsen"]
[Result "1-0"]
@end example
@noindent
Any characters that do not match this syntax are silently ignored. Note that
the PGN standard requires all games to have at least the seven tags shown
above. Any that you omit will be filled in by XBoard
with @samp{?} (unknown value), or @samp{-} (inapplicable value).
@item Edit Comment
@cindex Edit Comment, Menu Item
Adds or modifies a comment on the current position. Comments are
saved by @samp{Save Game} and are displayed by @samp{Load Game},
@samp{Forward}, and @samp{Backward}.
@item ICS Input Box
@cindex ICS Input Box, Menu Item
If this option is set in ICS mode,
XBoard
creates an extra window that you can use for typing in ICS commands.
The input box is especially useful if you want to type in something long or do
some editing on your input, because output from ICS doesn't get mixed
in with your typing as it would in the main terminal window.
@item Pause
@cindex Pause, Menu Item
Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against a chess engine,
also pauses your clock. To continue, select @samp{Pause} again, and the
display will automatically update to the latest position.
The @samp{P} button and keyboard @kbd{p} key are equivalents.

If you select Pause when you are playing against a chess engine and
it is not your move, the chess engine's clock
will continue to run and it will eventually make a move, at which point
both clocks will stop. Since board updates are paused, however,
you will not see the move until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward).
This behavior is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

If you select Pause while you are observing or examining a game on a
chess server, you can step backward and forward in the current history
of the examined game without affecting the other observers and
examiners, and without having your display jump forward to the latest
position each time a move is made. Select Pause again to reconnect
yourself to the current state of the game on ICS.

If you select @samp{Pause} while you are loading a game, the game stops
loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting @samp{Forward}, or
resume automatic loading by selecting @samp{Pause} again.

@item Accept
@cindex Accept, Menu Item
Accepts a pending match offer. If there is more than one offer
pending, you will have to type in a more specific command
instead of using this menu choice.
@item Decline
@cindex Decline, Menu Item
Declines a pending offer (match, draw, adjourn, etc.). If there
is more than one offer pending, you will have to type in a more
specific command instead of using this menu choice.
@item Call Flag
@cindex Call Flag, Menu Item
Calls your opponent's flag, claiming a win on time, or claiming
a draw if you are both out of time. You can also call your
opponent's flag by clicking on his clock or by pressing the
keyboard @kbd{t} key.
@item Draw
@cindex Draw, Menu Item
Offers a draw to your opponent, accepts a pending draw offer
from your opponent, or claims a draw by repetition or the 50-move
rule, as appropriate. The @kbd{d} key is a keyboard equivalent.
@item Adjourn
@cindex Adjourn, Menu Item
Asks your opponent to agree to adjourning the current game, or
agrees to a pending adjournment offer from your opponent.
@item Abort
@cindex Abort, Menu Item
Asks your opponent to agree to aborting the current game, or
agrees to a pending abort offer from your opponent. An aborted
game ends immediately without affecting either player's rating.
@item Resign
@cindex Resign, Menu Item
Resigns the game to your opponent. The shifted @kbd{R} key is a
keyboard equivalent.
@item Stop Observing
@cindex Stop Observing, Menu Item
Ends your participation in observing a game, by issuing the ICS
observe command with no arguments. ICS mode only.
@item Stop Examining
@cindex Stop Examining, Menu Item
Ends your participation in examining a game, by issuing the ICS
unexamine command. ICS mode only.

@item Backward
@cindex Backward, Menu Item
@cindex <, Button
Steps backward through a series of remembered moves.
The @samp{[<]} button and the @kbd{b} key are equivalents.
In addition, pressing the Control key steps back one move, and releasing
it steps forward again.

In most modes, @samp{Backward} only lets you look back at old positions;
it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are playing against
a chess engine, playing or observing a game on an ICS, or loading a game.
If you select @samp{Backward} in any of these situations, you will not
be allowed to make a different move. Use @samp{Retract Move} or
@samp{Edit Game} if you want to change past moves.

If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of @samp{Backward}
depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, @samp{Backward} issues the ICS backward command, which backs up
everyone's view of the game and allows you to make a different
move. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Backward} only backs up your local
view.
@item Forward
@cindex Forward, Menu Item
@cindex >, Button
Steps forward through a series of remembered moves (undoing the
effect of @samp{Backward}) or forward through a game file. The
@samp{[>]} button and the @kbd{f} key are equivalents.

If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of Forward
depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, @samp{Forward} issues the ICS forward command, which moves
everyone's view of the game forward along the current line. If
Pause mode is on, @samp{Forward} only moves your local view forward,
and it will not go past the position that the game was in when
you paused.
@item Back to Start
@cindex Back to Start, Menu Item
@cindex <<, Button
Jumps backward to the first remembered position in the game.
The @samp{[<<]} button and the shifted @kbd{B} key are equivalents.

In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back at old
positions; it does not retract moves. This is the case if you
are playing against a local chess engine, playing or observing a game on
a chess server, or loading a game. If you select @samp{Back to Start} in any
of these situations, you will not be allowed to make different
moves. Use @samp{Retract Move} or @samp{Edit Game} if you want to change past
moves; or use Reset to start a new game.

If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of @samp{Back to
Start} depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, @samp{Back to Start} issues the ICS @samp{backward 999999}
command, which backs up everyone's view of the game to the start and
allows you to make different moves. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Back
to Start} only backs up your local view.
@item Forward to End
@cindex Forward to End, Menu Item
@cindex >>, Button
Jumps forward to the last remembered position in the game. The
@samp{[>>]} button and the shifted @kbd{F} key are equivalents.

If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of @samp{Forward to
End} depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, @samp{Forward to End} issues the ICS @samp{forward 999999}
command, which moves everyone's view of the game forward to the end of
the current line. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Forward to End} only moves
your local view forward, and it will not go past the position
that the game was in when you paused.
@item Revert
@cindex Revert, Menu Item
If you are examining an ICS game and Pause mode is off, issues
the ICS command @samp{revert}.
@item Truncate Game
@cindex Truncate Game, Menu Item
Discards all remembered moves of the game beyond the current
position. Puts XBoard into @samp{Edit Game} mode if it was not there
already.
@item Move Now
@cindex Move Now, Menu Item
Forces the chess engine to move immediately. Chess engine mode only.
@item Retract Move
@cindex Retract Move, Menu Item
Retracts your last move. In chess engine mode, you can do this only
after the chess engine has replied to your move; if the chess engine is still
thinking, use @samp{Move Now} first. In ICS mode, @samp{Retract Move}
issues the command @samp{takeback 1} or @samp{takeback 2}
depending on whether it is your opponent's move or yours.

@item Always Queen
@cindex Always Queen, Menu Item
If this option is off, XBoard brings up a dialog
box whenever you move a pawn to the last rank, asking what piece
you want to promote it to. If the option is true, your pawns are
always promoted to queens. Your opponent can still underpromote.
@item Animate Dragging
@cindex Animate Dragging, Menu Item
If Animate Dragging is on, while you are dragging a piece with the
mouse, an image of the piece follows the mouse cursor.
If Animate Dragging is off, there is no visual feedback while you are
dragging a piece, but if Animate Moving is on, the move will be
animated when it is complete. 
@item Animate Moving
@cindex Animate Moving, Menu Item
If Animate Moving is on, all piece moves are animated.  An image of the
piece is shown moving from the old square to the new square when the
move is completed (unless the move was already animated by Animate Dragging).
If Animate Moving is off, a moved piece instantly disappears from its
old square and reappears on its new square when the move is complete.
@item Auto Comment
@cindex Auto Comment, Menu Item
If this option is on, any remarks made on ICS while you are observing or
playing a game are recorded as a comment on the current move.  This includes
remarks made with the ICS commands @kbd{say}, @kbd{tell}, @kbd{whisper},
and @kbd{kibitz}.
Limitation: remarks that you type yourself are not recognized;
XBoard scans only the output from ICS, not the input you type to it.
@item Auto Flag
@cindex Auto Flag, Menu Item
If this option is on and one player runs out of time
before the other,
XBoard
will automatically call his flag, claiming a win on time.
In ICS mode, Auto Flag will only call your opponent's flag, not yours,
and the ICS may award you a draw instead of a win if you have
insufficient mating material.  In local chess engine mode,
XBoard
may call either player's flag and will not take material into account.
@item Auto Flip View
@cindex Auto Flip View, Menu Item
If the Auto Flip View option is on when you start a game, the board
will be automatically oriented so that your pawns move from the bottom
of the window towards the top.
@item Auto Observe
@cindex Auto Observe, Menu Item
If this option is on and you add a player to your @code{gnotify}
list on ICS, XBoard will automatically observe all of that
player's games, unless you are doing something else (such as
observing or playing a game of your own) when one starts.
The games are displayed 
from the point of view of the player on your gnotify list; that is, his
pawns move from the bottom of the window towards the top.
Exceptions:  If both players in a game are on your gnotify list, if
your ICS 
@code{highlight}
variable is set to 0, or if the ICS you are using does not 
properly support observing from Black's point of view,
you will see the game from White's point of view.
@item Auto Raise Board
@cindex Auto Raise Board, Menu Item
If this option is on, whenever a new game begins, the chessboard window
is deiconized (if necessary) and raised to the top of the stack of windows.
@item Auto Save
@cindex Auto Save, Menu Item
If this option is true, at the end of every game XBoard prompts
you for a file name and appends a record of the game to the file
you specify. 
Disabled if the @code{saveGameFile} command-line
option is set, as in that case all games are saved to the specified file.
@xref{Load and Save options}.
@item Blindfold
@cindex Blindfold, Menu Item
If this option is on, XBoard displays the board as usual but does
not display pieces or move highlights.  You can still move in the
usual way (with the mouse or by typing moves in ICS mode), even though
the pieces are invisible.
@item Flash Moves
@cindex Flash Moves, Menu Item
If this option is on, whenever a move is completed, the moved piece flashes.
The number of times to flash is set by the flashCount command-line
option; it defaults to 3 if Flash Moves is first turned on from the menu.
@item Flip View
@cindex Flip View, Menu Item
Inverts your view of the chess board for the duration of the
current game. Starting a new game returns the board to normal.
The @kbd{v} key is a keyboard equivalent.

If you are playing a game on an ICS, the board is always
oriented at the start of the game so that your pawns move from
the bottom of the window towards the top. Otherwise, the starting
orientation is determined by the @code{flipView} command line option;
if it is false (the default), White's pawns move from bottom to top
at the start of each game; if it is true, Black's pawns move from
bottom to top. @xref{User interface options}.
@item Get Move List
@cindex Get Move List, Menu Item
If this option is on, whenever XBoard
receives the first board of a new ICS game (or a different game from
the one it is currently displaying), it
retrieves the list of past moves from the ICS.
You can then review the moves with the @samp{Forward} and @samp{Backward}
commands
or save them with @samp{Save Game}.  You might want to
turn off this option if you are observing several blitz games at once,
to keep from wasting time and network bandwidth fetching the move lists over
and over.
When you turn this option on from the menu, XBoard
immediately fetches the move list of the current game (if any).
@item Highlight Last Move
@cindex Highlight Last Move, Menu Item
If Highlight Last Move is on, after a move is made, the starting and
ending squares remain highlighted. In addition, after you use Backward
or Back to Start, the starting and ending squares of the last move to
be unmade are highlighted.
@item Move Sound
@cindex Move Sound, Menu Item
If this option is on, XBoard alerts you by playing a sound
after each of your opponent's moves (or after every
move if you are observing a game on the Internet Chess Server).
The sound is not played after moves you make or moves read from a
saved game file. By default, the
sound is the terminal bell, but on some systems you can change it
to a sound file using the soundMove option; see below.

If you turn on this option when using XBoard with the Internet
Chess Server, you will probably want to give the
@kbd{set bell 0}
command to the ICS, since otherwise the ICS will ring the terminal bell
after every move (not just yours). (The @file{.icsrc} file
is a good place for this; see @ref{ICS options}.)
@item ICS Alarm
@cindex ICS Alarm, Menu Item
When this option is on, an alarm sound is played when your clock
counts down to the icsAlarmTime (by default, 5 seconds) in an ICS
game.  For games with time controls that include an increment, the
alarm will sound each time the clock counts down to the icsAlarmTime.
By default, the alarm sound is the terminal bell, but on some systems
you can change it to a sound file using the soundIcsAlarm option; see
below.
@item Old Save Style
@cindex Old Save Style, Menu Item
If this option is off, XBoard saves games in PGN
(portable game notation) and positions in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards
notation).  If the option is on, a save style that is compatible
with older versions of XBoard is used instead.
The old position style is more human-readable
than FEN; the old game style has no particular advantages.
@item Periodic Updates
@cindex Periodic Updates, Menu Item
If this option is off (or if
you are using a chess engine that does not support periodic updates),
the analysis window
will only be updated when the analysis changes. If this option is
on, the Analysis Window will be updated every two seconds.
@item Ponder Next Move
@cindex Ponder Next Move, Menu Item
If this option is off, the chess engine will think only when it is on
move.  If the option is on, the engine will also think while waiting
for you to make your move.
@item Popup Exit Message
@cindex Popup Exit Message, Menu Item
If this option is on, when XBoard wants to display a message just
before exiting, it brings up a modal dialog box and waits for you to
click OK before exiting.  If the option is off, XBoard prints the
message to standard error (the terminal) and exits immediately.
@item Popup Move Errors
@cindex Popup Move Errors, Menu Item
If this option is off, when you make an error in moving (such as
attempting an illegal move or moving the wrong color piece), the
error message is displayed in the message area.  If the option is
on, move errors are displayed in small popup windows like other errors.
You can dismiss an error popup either by clicking its OK button or by
clicking anywhere on the board, including downclicking to start a move.
@item Premove
@cindex Premove, Menu Item
If this option is on while playing a game on an ICS, you can register
your next planned move before it is your turn.  Move the piece with
the mouse in the ordinary way, and the starting and ending squares
will be highlighted with a special color (red by default).  When it is
your turn, if your registered move is legal, XBoard will send it to
ICS immediately; if not, it will be ignored and you can make a
different move.  If you change your mind about your premove, either
make a different move, or double-click on any piece to cancel the move
entirely.
@item Quiet Play
@cindex Quiet Play, Menu Item
If this option is on, XBoard will automatically issue an ICS
@kbd{set shout 0}
command whenever you start a game and a
@kbd{set shout 1}
command whenever you finish one.  Thus, you will not be distracted
by shouts from other ICS users while playing.
@item Show Coords
@cindex Show Coords, Menu Item
If this option is on, XBoard displays algebraic coordinates
along the board's left and bottom edges.
@item Show Thinking
@cindex Show Thinking, Menu Item
If this option is set, the chess engine's notion of the score and best
line of play from the current position is displayed as it is
thinking. The score indicates how many pawns ahead (or if negative,
behind) the chess engine thinks it is. In matches between two
machines, the score is prefixed by @samp{W} or @samp{B} to indicate
whether it is showing White's thinking or Black's, and only the thinking
of the engine that is on move is shown.
@item Test Legality
@cindex Test Legality, Menu Item
If this option is on, XBoard tests whether the moves you try to make
with the mouse are legal and refuses to let you make an illegal move.
Moves loaded from a file with @samp{Load Game} are also checked.  If
the option is off, all moves are accepted, but if a local chess engine
or the ICS is active, they will still reject illegal moves.  Turning
off this option is useful if you are playing a chess variant with
rules that XBoard does not understand.  (Bughouse, suicide, and wild
variants where the king may castle after starting on the d file are
generally supported with Test Legality on.)

With GNU Chess 4, the first column gives moves, the second column
gives one possible response for each move, and the third column shows
the number of lines in the book that include the move from the first
column. If you select this option and nothing happens, the chess

@item Iconize
Pressing the @kbd{i} or @kbd{c} key iconizes XBoard. The graphical
icon displays a white knight if it is White's move, or a black knight
if it is Black's move. If your X window manager displays only text
icons, not graphical ones, check its documentation; there is probably
a way to enable graphical icons.  If you get black and white reversed,
we would like to hear about it; see @ref{Problems} below for
instructions on how to report this problem.

@cindex Options

This section documents the command-line options to XBoard.  You can
set these options in two ways: by typing them on the shell command
line you use to start XBoard, or by setting them as X resources
(typically in your @file{.Xdefaults} file).  Many of the options
cannot be changed while XBoard is running; others set the initial
state of items that can be changed with the @ref{Options} menu.

Most of the options have both a long name and a short name. To turn a
boolean option on or off from the command line, either give its long
name followed by the value true or false
(@samp{-longOptionName true}), or give just the short name to turn the
option on (@samp{-opt}), or the short name preceded by @samp{x} to
turn the option off (@samp{-xopt}). For options that take strings or
numbers as values, you can use the long or short option names
interchangeably.

Each option corresponds to an X resource with the same name, so
if you like, you can set options in your @file{.Xdefaults} file
or in a file named @file{XBoard} in your home directory.
For options that have two names, the longer one is the name of
the corresponding X resource; the short name is not recognized.
To turn a boolean option on or off as an
X resource, give its long name followed by the value
true or false (@samp{XBoard*longOptionName: true}).

@cindex options, Chess engine
@cindex Chess engine options
@table @asis
@item -tc or -timeControl minutes[:seconds]
@cindex tc, option
@cindex timeControl, option
Each player begins with his clock set to the @code{timeControl} period.
Default: 5 minutes.
The additional options @code{movesPerSession} and @code{timeIncrement}
are mutually exclusive.  
@item -mps or -movesPerSession moves
@cindex mps, option
@cindex movesPerSession, option
When both players have made @code{movesPerSession} moves, a
new @code{timeControl} period is added to both clocks.  Default: 40 moves.
@item -inc or -timeIncrement seconds
@cindex inc, option
@cindex timeIncrement, option
If this option is specified, @code{movesPerSession} is ignored.
Instead, after each player's move, @code{timeIncrement} seconds are
added to his clock.  
Use @samp{-inc 0} if you want to require the entire
game to be played in one @code{timeControl} period, with no increment.
Default: -1, which specifies @code{movesPerSession} mode.
@item -clock/-xclock or -clockMode true/false
@cindex clock, option
@cindex clockMode, option
Determines whether or not to display the chess clocks. If clockMode is
false, the clocks are not shown, but the side that is to play next
is still highlighted. Also, unless @code{searchTime}
is set, the chess engine still keeps track of the clock time and uses it to
determine how fast to make its moves.
@item -st or -searchTime minutes[:seconds]
@cindex st, option
@cindex searchTime, option
Tells the chess engine to spend at most the given amount of time
searching for each of its moves. Without this option, the chess engine
chooses its search time based on the number of moves and amount
of time remaining until the next time control.
Setting this option also sets clockMode to false.
@item -depth or -searchDepth number
@cindex sd, option
@cindex searchDepth, option
Tells the chess engine to look ahead at most the given number of moves
when searching for a move to make. Without this option, the chess
engine chooses its search depth based on the number of moves and
amount of time remaining until the next time control.  With the option,
the engine will cut off its search early if it reaches the specified depth.
@item -thinking/-xthinking or -showThinking true/false
@cindex thinking, option
@cindex showThinking, option
Sets the Show Thinking option. @xref{Options Menu}. Default: false.
@item -ponder/-xponder or -ponderNextMove true/false
@cindex ponder, option
@cindex ponderNextMove, option
Sets the Ponder Next Move menu option. @xref{Options Menu}. Default: true.
@item -mg or -matchGames n
@cindex mg, option
@cindex matchGames, option
Automatically runs an n-game match between two chess engines,
with alternating colors.
If the @code{loadGameFile} or @code{loadPositionFile} option is set,
XBoard
starts each game with the given opening moves or the given position;
otherwise, the games start with the standard initial chess position.
If the @code{saveGameFile} option is set, a move record for the
match is appended to the specified file. If the @code{savePositionFile}
option is set, the final position reached in each game of the match is appended
to the specified file. When the match is over, XBoard
displays the match score and exits. Default: 0 (do not run a match).
@item -mm/-xmm or -matchMode true/false
@cindex mm, option
@cindex matchMode, option
Setting @code{matchMode} to true is equivalent to setting
@code{matchGames} to 1.
@item -fcp or -firstChessProgram program
@cindex fcp, option
@cindex firstChessProgram, option
Name of first chess engine.
Default: @file{gnuchessx}.
@item -scp or -secondChessProgram program
@cindex scp, option
@cindex secondChessProgram, option
Name of second chess engine, if needed.
A second chess engine is started only in Two Machines (match) mode.
Default: @file{gnuchessx}.
@item -fb/-xfb or -firstPlaysBlack true/false
@cindex fb, option
@cindex firstPlaysBlack, option
In games between two chess engines, firstChessProgram normally plays
white.  If this option is true, firstChessProgram plays black.  In a
multi-game match, this option affects the colors only for the first
game; they still alternate in subsequent games.
@item -fh or -firstHost host
@itemx -sh or -secondHost host
@cindex fh, option
@cindex firstHost, option
@cindex sh, option
@cindex secondHost, option
Hosts on which the chess engines are to run. The default for
each is @file{localhost}. If you specify another host, XBoard
uses @file{rsh} to run the chess engine there. (You can substitute a
different remote shell program for rsh using the @code{remoteShell}
option described below.)
@item -fd or -firstDirectory dir
@itemx -sd or -secondDirectory dir
@cindex fd, option
@cindex firstDirectory, option
@cindex sd, option
@cindex secondDirectory, option
Working directories in which the chess engines are to be run.
The default is "", which means to run the chess engine
in the same working directory as XBoard
itself.  (See the CHESSDIR environment variable.)
This option is effective only when the chess engine is being run
on the local host; it does not work if the engine is run remotely
using the -fh or -sh option.
@item -initString string
@itemx -secondInitString string
@cindex initString, option
@cindex secondInitString, option
The string that is sent to initialize each chess engine for a new game.
Default:

@example
new
random
@end example
@noindent
Setting this option from the command line is tricky, because you must
type in real newline characters, including one at the very end.
In most shells you can do this by
entering a @samp{\} character followed by a newline. It is easier to set
the option from your @file{.Xdefaults} file; in that case you can
include the character sequence @samp{\n} in the string, and it will
be converted to a newline.

If you change this option, don't remove the @samp{new} 
command; it is required by all chess engines to
start a new game.

You can remove the @samp{random} command if you like; including it
causes GNU Chess 4 to randomize its move selection slightly so that it
doesn't play the same moves in every game.  Even without
@samp{random}, GNU Chess 4 randomizes its choice of moves from its
opening book.  Many other chess engines ignore this command entirely
and always (or never) randomize.

You can also try adding other commands to the initString; see the
documentation of the chess engine you are using for details.
@item -firstComputerString string
@itemx -secondComputerString string
@cindex firstComputerString, option
@cindex secondComputerString, option
The string that is sent to the chess engine if its opponent is another
computer chess engine.  The default is @samp{computer\n}.  Probably the
only useful alternative is the empty string (@samp{}), which keeps the
engine from knowing that it is playing another computer.
@item -reuse/-xreuse or -reuseFirst true/false
@itemx -reuse2/-xreuse2 or -reuseSecond true/false
@cindex reuse, option
@cindex reuseFirst, option
@cindex reuse2, option
@cindex reuseSecond, option
If the option is false,
XBoard kills off the chess engine after every game and starts
it again for the next game.  
If the option is true (the default), 
XBoard starts the chess engine only once
and uses it repeatedly to play multiple games.
Some old chess engines may not work properly when
reuse is turned on, but otherwise games will start faster if it is left on.
@item -firstProtocolVersion version-number
@itemx -secondProtocolVersion version-number
@cindex firstProtocolVersion, option
@cindex secondProtocolVersion, option
This option specifies which version of the chess engine communication
protocol to use.  By default, version-number is 2.  In version 1, the
"protover" command is not sent to the engine; since version 1 is a
subset of version 2, nothing else changes.  Other values for
version-number are not supported.

@node ICS options
@section Internet Chess Server Options
@cindex ICS options
@cindex Options, ICS
@table @asis
@item -ics/-xics or -internetChessServerMode true/false
@cindex ics, option
@cindex internetChessServerMode, option
Connect with an Internet Chess Server to play chess against its
other users, observe games they are playing, or review games
that have recently finished. Default: false.
@item -icshost or -internetChessServerHost host
@cindex icshost, option
@cindex internetChessServerHost, option
The Internet host name or address of the chess server to connect
to when in ICS mode. Default: @code{chessclub.com}.
Another popular chess server to try is @code{freechess.org}.
If your site doesn't have a working Internet name server, try
specifying the host address in numeric form. 
You may also need
to specify the numeric address when using the icshelper option
with timestamp or timeseal (see below).
@item -icsport or -internetChessServerPort port-number
@cindex icsport, option
@cindex internetChessServerPort, option
The port number to use when connecting to a chess server in ICS
mode. Default: 5000.
@item -icshelper or -internetChessServerHelper prog-name
@cindex icshelper, option
@cindex internetChessServerHelper, option
An external helper program used to communicate with the chess server.
You would set it to "timestamp" for ICC (chessclub.com) or
"timeseal" for FICS (freechess.org), after
obtaining the correct version of timestamp or timeseal for your
computer.  See "help timestamp" on ICC and "help timeseal" on FICS.
This option is shorthand for @code{-useTelnet -telnetProgram program}.
@item -telnet/-xtelnet or -useTelnet true/false
@cindex telnet, option
@cindex useTelnet, option
This option is poorly named; it should be called useHelper.
If set to true, it instructs XBoard to run an external
program to communicate with the Internet Chess Server. 
The program to use is given by the telnetProgram option.
If the option is
false (the default), XBoard opens a TCP socket and uses its own
internal implementation of the telnet protocol to communicate with the
ICS. @xref{Firewalls}.
@item -telnetProgram prog-name
@cindex telnetProgram, option
This option is poorly named; it should be called helperProgram.
It gives the name of the telnet program to be used with
the @code{gateway} and @code{useTelnet} options.  The default is
@file{telnet}. The telnet program is invoked with the value of
@code{internetChessServerHost} as its first argument and the value
of @code{internetChessServerPort} as its second argument.
@xref{Firewalls}.
@item -gateway host-name
@cindex gateway, option
If this option is set to a host name, XBoard communicates with the
Internet Chess Server by using @file{rsh} to run
the @code{telnetProgram} on the given host,
instead of using its own internal implementation
of the telnet protocol. You can substitute a different remote shell
program for @file{rsh} using the @code{remoteShell} option described below.
@xref{Firewalls}.
@item -internetChessServerCommPort or -icscomm dev-name
@cindex internetChessServerCommPort, option
@cindex icscomm, option
If this option is set, XBoard communicates with the ICS through
the given character I/O device instead of opening a TCP connection.
Use this option if your system does not have any kind of
Internet connection itself (not even a SLIP or PPP connection),
but you do have dialup access (or a hardwired terminal line) to
an Internet service provider from which you can telnet to the ICS.

The support for this option in XBoard is minimal. You need to
set all communication parameters and tty modes before you enter
XBoard.

Use a script something like this:

@example
stty raw -echo 9600 > /dev/tty00
xboard -ics -icscomm /dev/tty00
@end example

Here replace @samp{/dev/tty00} with the name of the device that your
modem is connected to. You might have to add several more
options to these stty commands. See the man pages for @file{stty}
and @code{tty} if you run into problems. Also, on many systems stty
works on its standard input instead of standard output, so you
have to use @samp{<} instead of @samp{>}.

If you are using linux, try starting with the script below.
Change it as necessary for your installation.

@example
#!/bin/sh -f
# configure modem and fire up XBoard

# configure modem
(
  stty 2400 ; stty raw ; stty hupcl ; stty -clocal
  stty ignbrk ; stty ignpar ; stty ixon ; stty ixoff
  stty -iexten ; stty -echo
) < /dev/modem
xboard -ics -icscomm /dev/modem
@end example
@noindent
After you start XBoard in this way, type whatever commands are
necessary to dial out to your Internet provider and log in.
Then telnet to ICS, using a command like
@kbd{telnet chessclub.com 5000}.
Important: See the paragraph below about extra echoes, 
in @ref{Limitations}.
@item -icslogon or -internetChessServerLogonScript file-name
@cindex icslogon, option
@cindex internetChessServerLogonScript, option
@cindex .icsrc
Whenever XBoard connects to the Internet Chess Server,
if it finds a file with the name given in this option, it feeds the
file's contents to the ICS as commands. The default file name

Usually the first two lines of the file should be
your ICS user name and password.
The file can be either in $CHESSDIR, in XBoard's working
directory if CHESSDIR is not set, or in your home directory.
@item -msLoginDelay delay
@cindex msLoginDelay, option
If you experience trouble logging on to an ICS when using the
@code{-icslogon} option, inserting some delay between characters
of the logon script may help. This option adds @code{delay}
milliseconds of delay between characters. Good values to try
are 100 and 250.

@item -colorizeMessages or -colorize
@cindex Colors
@cindex colorize, option
Setting colorizeMessages
to true tells XBoard to colorize the messages received from
the ICS.  Colorization works only if your xterm 
supports ISO 6429 escape sequences for changing text colors.
@item -colorShout foreground,background,bold

@cindex colorKibitz, option
@cindex colorTell, option
@cindex colorChallenge, option
@cindex colorRequest, option
@cindex colorSeek, option
@cindex colorNormal, option
These options set the colors used when colorizing ICS messages.
All ICS messages are grouped into one of these categories:
shout, sshout, channel 1, other channel, kibitz, tell, challenge, 
request (including abort, adjourn, draw, pause, and takeback), or
normal (all other messages).  

Each foreground or background argument can be one of the following:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, or default.
Here ``default'' means the default foreground or background color of
your xterm.  Bold can be 1 or 0.  If background is omitted, ``default''
is assumed; if bold is omitted, 0 is assumed.

Here is an example of how to set the colors in your @file{.Xdefaults} file.
The colors shown here are the default values; you will get
them if you turn @code{-colorize} on without specifying your own colors.

@example
xboard*colorizeMessages: true	
xboard*colorShout: green
xboard*colorSShout: green, black, 1
xboard*colorChannel1: cyan
xboard*colorChannel: cyan, black, 1

@item -soundProgram progname
@cindex soundProgram, option
@cindex Sounds
If this option is set to a sound-playing program that is installed and
working on your system, XBoard can play sound files when certain
events occur, listed below.  The default program name is "play".  If
any of the sound options is set to "$", the event rings the terminal
bell by sending a ^G character to standard output, instead of playing
a sound file.  If an option is set to the empty string "", no sound is
played for that event.

pops up a menu of the available games, with entries based on their PGN 
(Portable Game Notation) tags.
If the @code{loadGameIndex} option is set to @samp{N}, the menu is suppressed
and the N th game found in the file is loaded immediately.
The menu is also suppressed if @code{matchMode} is enabled or if the game file
is a pipe; in these cases the first game in the file is loaded immediately.
Use the @file{pxboard} shell script provided with XBoard if you

@item -size or -boardSize (sizeName | n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6,n7)
@cindex size, option
@cindex boardSize, option
@cindex board size
Determines how large the board will be, by selecting the pixel size
of the pieces and setting a few related parameters.
The sizeName can be one of: Titanic, giving 129x129 pixel pieces,
Colossal 116x116, Giant 108x108, Huge 95x95, Big 87x87, Large 80x80, Bulky 72x72,
Medium 64x64, Moderate 58x58, Average 54x54, Middling 49x49, Mediocre
45x45, Small 40x40, Slim 37x37, Petite 33x33, Dinky 29x29, Teeny 25x25,
or Tiny 21x21.
Pieces of all these sizes are built into XBoard.
Other sizes can
be used if you have them; see the pixmapDirectory and bitmapDirectory
options.
The default depends on the size of your screen; it is approximately the
largest size that will fit without clipping.

You can select other sizes or vary other layout parameters by providing
a list of comma-separated values (with no spaces) as the argument.
You do not need to provide all the values; for any you omit from the
end of the list, defaults are taken from the nearest built-in size.
The value @code{n1} gives the piece size, @code{n2} the width of the
black border
between squares, @code{n3} the desired size for the 
clockFont, @code{n4} the desired size for the coordFont,
@code{n5} the desired size for the default font,
@code{n6} the smallLayout flag (0 or 1), 
and @code{n7} the tinyLayout flag (0 or 1).  
All dimensions are in pixels.
If the border between squares is eliminated (0 width), the various
highlight options will not work, as there is nowhere to draw the highlight.
If smallLayout is 1 and @code{titleInWindow} is true, 
the window layout is rearranged to make more room for the title.
If tinyLayout is 1, the labels on the menu bar are abbreviated
to one character each and the buttons in the button bar are made narrower.
@item -coords/-xcoords or -showCoords true/false
@cindex coords, option
@cindex showCoords, option
Sets the Show Coords menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}.  Default: false.
The @code{coordFont} option specifies what font to use.
@item -autoraise/-xautoraise or -autoRaiseBoard true/false
@cindex autoraise, option
@cindex autoRaiseBoard, option
Sets the Auto Raise Board menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}.  Default: true.
@item -autoflip/-xautoflip or -autoFlipView true/false
@cindex autoflip, option
@cindex autoFlipView, option
Sets the Auto Flip View menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}.  Default: true.
@item -flip/-xflip or -flipView true/false
@cindex flip, option
@cindex flipView, option
If Auto Flip View is not set, or if you are observing but not participating
in a game, then the positioning of the board at the start of each game
depends on the flipView option.  If flipView is false (the default),
the board is positioned so that the white pawns move from the bottom to the
top; if true, the black pawns move from the bottom to the top.
In any case, the Flip menu option (see @ref{Options Menu})
can be used to flip the board after
the game starts.
@item -title/-xtitle or -titleInWindow true/false
@cindex title, option
@cindex titleInWindow, option
If this option is true, XBoard displays player names (for ICS
games) and game file names (for @samp{Load Game}) inside its main
window. If the option is false (the default), this information is
displayed only in the window banner. You probably won't want to
set this option unless the information is not showing up in the
banner, as happens with a few X window managers.
@item -buttons/-xbuttons or -showButtonBar True/False
@cindex buttons, option
@cindex showButtonBar, option
If this option is False, xboard omits the [<<] [<] [P] [>] [>>] button
bar from the window, allowing the message line to be wider.  You can
still get the functions of these buttons using the menus or their keyboard
shortcuts.  Default: true.
@item -mono/-xmono or -monoMode true/false
@cindex mono, option
@cindex monoMode, option
Determines whether XBoard displays its pieces and squares with
two colors (true) or four (false). You shouldn't have to
specify @code{monoMode}; XBoard will determine if it is necessary.
@item -flashCount count
@itemx -flashRate rate

These options enable flashing of pieces when they
land on their destination square.
@code{flashCount}
tells XBoard how many times to flash a piece after it
lands on its destination square.
@code{flashRate}
controls the rate of flashing (flashes/sec).
Abbreviations:
@code{flash}
sets flashCount to 3.
@code{xflash}
sets flashCount to 0.
Defaults:  flashCount=0 (no flashing), flashRate=5.
@item -highlight/-xhighlight or -highlightLastMove true/false

@item -clockFont font
@cindex clockFont, option
@cindex Font, clock
The font used for the clocks. If the option value is a pattern
that does not specify the font size, XBoard tries to choose an
appropriate font for the board size being used.
Default: -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.
@item -coordFont font
@cindex coordFont, option
@cindex Font, coordinates
The font used for rank and file coordinate labels if @code{showCoords}
is true. If the option value is a pattern that does not specify
the font size, XBoard tries to choose an appropriate font for
the board size being used.
Default: -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.
@item -font font
@cindex font, option
@cindex Font
The font used for popup dialogs, menus, comments, etc.
If the option value is a pattern that does not specify
the font size, XBoard tries to choose an appropriate font for
the board size being used.
Default: -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.
@item -fontSizeTolerance tol
@cindex fontSizeTolerance, option
In the font selection algorithm, a nonscalable font will be preferred
over a scalable font if the nonscalable font's size differs
by @code{tol} pixels
or less from the desired size.  A value of -1 will force
a scalable font to always be used if available; a value of 0 will
use a nonscalable font only if it is exactly the right size; 
a large value (say 1000) will force a nonscalable font to always be
used if available.  Default: 4.
@item -bm or -bitmapDirectory dir
@itemx -pixmap or -pixmapDirectory dir
@cindex bm, option
@cindex bitmapDirectory, option
@cindex pixmap, option
@cindex pixmapDirectory, option
These options control what piece images xboard uses.  The XBoard
distribution includes one set of pixmap pieces in xpm format, in the
directory @file{pixmaps}, and one set of bitmap pieces in xbm format,
in the directory @file{bitmaps}.  Pixmap
pieces give a better appearance on the screen: the white pieces have
dark borders, and the black pieces have opaque internal details.  With
bitmaps, neither piece color has a border, and the internal details
are transparent; you see the square color or other background color
through them.

If XBoard is configured and compiled on a system that includes libXpm,
the X pixmap library, the xpm pixmap pieces are compiled in as the
default.  A different xpm piece set can be selected at runtime with
the @code{pixmapDirectory} option, or a bitmap piece set can be selected
with the @code{bitmapDirectory} option.

If XBoard is configured and compiled on a system that does not include
libXpm (or the @code{--disable-xpm} option is given to the configure
program), the bitmap pieces are compiled in as the default.  It is not
possible to use xpm pieces in this case, but pixmap pieces in another
format called "xim" can be used by giving the @code{pixmapDirectory} option.
Or again, a different bitmap piece set can be selected with the
@code{bitmapDirectory} option.

Files in the @code{bitmapDirectory} must be named as follows:
The first character of a piece bitmap name gives the piece it 
represents (@samp{p}, @samp{n}, @samp{b}, @samp{r}, @samp{q}, or @samp{k}),
the next characters give the size in pixels, the
following character indicates whether the piece is
solid or outline (@samp{s} or @samp{o}),
and the extension is @samp{.bm}.
For example, a solid 80x80 knight would be named @file{n80s.bm}.
The outline bitmaps are used only in monochrome mode.
If bitmap pieces are compiled in and the bitmapDirectory is missing
some files, the compiled in pieces are used instead.

If the bitmapDirectory option is given,
it is also possible to replace xboard's icons and menu checkmark,
by supplying files named @file{icon_white.bm}, @file{icon_black.bm}, and
@file{checkmark.bm}.

For more information about pixmap pieces and how to get additional
sets, see @ref{zic2xpm} below.

In the shuffle variants, xboard does not shuffle the pieces, but
you can do it by hand using Edit Position.  Some variants are
supported only in ICS mode, including fischerandom, bughouse, and
kriegspiel.  The winning/drawing conditions in crazyhouse (offboard
interposition on mate), losers, suicide, giveaway, atomic, and 3check

@cindex ICS, addresses
@cindex Internet Chess Server
An @dfn{Internet Chess Server}, or @dfn{ICS}, is a place on the
Internet where people can get together to play chess, watch other
people's games, or just chat.  You can use either @code{telnet} or a
client program like XBoard to connect to the server.  There are
thousands of registered users on the different ICS hosts, and it is
not unusual to meet 200 on both chessclub.com and freechess.org.

Most people can just type @kbd{xboard -ics} to start XBoard as an ICS
client.  Invoking XBoard in this way connects you to the Internet
Chess Club (ICC), a commercial ICS.  You can log in there as a guest
even if you do not have a paid account.  To connect to the largest
Free ICS (FICS), use the command @kbd{xboard -ics -icshost freechess.org}
instead, or substitute a different host name to connect to your
favorite ICS.
For a full description of command-line options that control 
the connection to ICS and change the default values of ICS options, see
@ref{ICS options}.  

While you are running XBoard as an ICS client,
you use the terminal window that you started XBoard from
as a place to type in commands and read information that is
not available on the chessboard.

The first time you need to use the terminal is to enter your login name
and password, if you are a registered player. (You don't need to do
this manually; the @code{icsLogon} option can do it for you.
@pxref{ICS options}.)  If you are not registered, 
enter @kbd{g} as your name, and the server will pick a
unique guest name for you.

Some useful ICS commands
include
@table @kbd
@item help <topic>
@cindex help, ICS command
to get help on the given <topic>. To get a list of possible topics type
@dfn{help} without topic.  Try the help command before you ask other
people on the server for help.

For example @kbd{help register} tells you how to become a registered
ICS player.
@item who <flags>
@cindex who, ICS command
to see a list of people who are logged on.  Administrators
(people you should talk to if you have a problem) are marked
with the character @samp{*}, an asterisk. The <flags> allow you to
display only selected players: For example, @kbd{who of} shows a
list of players who are interested in playing but do not have
an opponent.
@item games
@cindex games, ICS command
to see what games are being played
@item match <player> [<mins>] [<inc>]
to challenge another player to a game. Both opponents get <mins> minutes
for the game, and <inc> seconds will be added after each move.
If another player challenges you, the server asks if you want to
accept the challenge; use the @kbd{accept} or @kbd{decline} commands
to answer.
@item accept
@itemx decline
@cindex accept, ICS command
@cindex decline, ICS command
to accept or decline another player's offer. 
The offer may be to start a new game, or to agree to a 
@kbd{draw}, @kbd{adjourn} or @kbd{abort} the current game. @xref{Action Menu}.

If you have more than one pending offer (for example, if more than one player
is challenging you, or if your opponent offers both a draw and to adjourn the
game), you have to supply additional information, by typing something
like @kbd{accept <player>}, @kbd{accept draw}, or @kbd{draw}.
@item draw
@itemx adjourn
@itemx abort
@cindex draw, ICS command
@cindex adjourn, ICS command
@cindex abort, ICS command
asks your opponent to terminate a game by mutual agreement. Adjourned
games can be continued later. 
Your opponent can either @kbd{decline} your offer or accept it (by typing the
same command or typing @kbd{accept}).  In some cases these commands work
immediately, without asking your opponent to agree.  For example, you can
abort the game unilaterally if your opponent is out of time, and you can claim
a draw by repetition or the 50-move rule if available simply by typing 
@kbd{draw}.
@item finger <player>
@cindex finger, ICS command
to get information about the given <player>. (Default: yourself.)
@item vars
@cindex vars, ICS command
to get a list of personal settings
@item set <var> <value>
@cindex set, ICS command
to modify these settings
@item observe <player>
@cindex observe, ICS command
to observe an ongoing game of the given <player>.
@item examine
@itemx oldmoves
@cindex examine, ICS command
@cindex oldmoves, ICS command
to review a recently completed game
@end table

Some special XBoard features are activated when you are
in examine mode on ICS.  See the descriptions of the menu commands
@samp{Forward}, @samp{Backward}, @samp{Pause}, @samp{ICS Client}, 
and @samp{Stop Examining} on the @ref{Step Menu}, @ref{Mode Menu}, and
@ref{Options Menu}.

@node Firewalls
@chapter Firewalls
By default, XBoard communicates with an Internet Chess Server
by opening a TCP socket directly from the machine it is running on
to the ICS. If there is a firewall between your machine and the ICS,
this won't work. Here are some recipes for getting around common
kinds of firewalls using special options to XBoard.
Important: See the paragraph in the below about extra echoes, in
@ref{Limitations}.

Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can telnet
to a firewall host, log in, and then telnet from there to ICS.
Let's say the firewall is called @samp{firewall.example.com}. Set
command-line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -icshost firewall.example.com -icsport 23
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: firewall.example.com
XBoard*internetChessServerPort: 23
@end example
@noindent
Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, you will be prompted
to log in to the firewall host. This works because port 23 is the
standard telnet login service. Do so, then telnet to ICS, using a
command like @samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000}, or whatever command
the firewall provides for telnetting to port 5000.

If your firewall lets you telnet (or rlogin) to remote hosts but
doesn't let you telnet to port 5000, you may be able to connect to the
chess server on port 23 instead, which is the port the telnet program
uses by default.  Some chess servers support this (including
chessclub.com and freechess.org), while some do not.

If your chess server does not allow connections on port 23 and your
firewall does not allow you to connect to other ports, you may be able
to connect by hopping through another host outside the firewall that
you have an account on.  For instance, suppose you have a shell
account at @samp{foo.edu}. Follow the recipe above, but instead of
typing @samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000} to the firewall, type
@samp{telnet foo.edu} (or @samp{rlogin foo.edu}), log in there, and
then type @samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000}.

Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can use rsh
to run programs on a firewall host, and that host can telnet to ICS.
Let's say the firewall is called @samp{rsh.example.com}. Set
command-line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -gateway rsh.example.com -icshost chessclub.com
@end example

@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*gateway: rsh.example.com
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: chessclub.com
@end example

Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will connect to
the ICS by using @file{rsh} to run the command
@samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000} on host @samp{rsh.example.com}.

Suppose that you can telnet anywhere you want, but you have to
run a special program called @file{ptelnet} to do so.

First, we'll consider the easy case, in which
@samp{ptelnet chessclub.com 5000} gets you to the chess server.
In this case set command line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet
@end example

@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*useTelnet: true
XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
@end example

@noindent
Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will issue the
command @samp{ptelnet chessclub.com 5000} to connect to the ICS.

Next, suppose that @samp{ptelnet chessclub.com 5000} doesn't work;
that is, your @file{ptelnet} program doesn't let you connect to
alternative ports. As noted above, your chess server may allow you to
connect on port 23 instead.  In that case, just add the option
@samp{-icsport ""} to the above command, or add
@samp{XBoard*internetChessServerPort:} to your @file{.Xdefaults} file.
But if your chess server doesn't let you connect on port 23, you will have
to find some other host outside the firewall and hop through it. For
instance, suppose you have a shell account at @samp{foo.edu}. Set
command line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet -icshost foo.edu -icsport ""
@end example

@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*useTelnet: true
XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: foo.edu
XBoard*internetChessServerPort:
@end example

@noindent
Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will issue the
command @samp{ptelnet foo.edu} to connect to your account at
@samp{foo.edu}. Log in there, then type @samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000}.

ICC timestamp and FICS timeseal do not work through some
firewalls.  You can use them only if your firewall gives a clean TCP
connection with a full 8-bit wide path.  If your firewall allows you
to get out only by running a special telnet program, you can't use
timestamp or timeseal across it.  But if you have access to a
computer just outside your firewall, and you have much lower netlag
when talking to that computer than to the ICS, it might be worthwhile
running timestamp there.  Follow the instructions above for hopping
through a host outside the firewall (foo.edu in the example),
but run timestamp or timeseal on that host instead of telnet.

Suppose that you have a SOCKS firewall that will give you a clean
8-bit wide TCP connection to the chess server, but only after you
authenticate yourself via the SOCKS protocol.  In that case, you could
make a socksified version of XBoard and run that.  If you are using
timestamp or timeseal, you will to socksify it, not XBoard; this may
be difficult seeing that ICC and FICS do not provide source code for
these programs.  Socksification is beyond the scope of this document,
but see the SOCKS Web site at http://www.socks.permeo.com/.
If you are missing SOCKS, try http://www.funbureau.com/.

@node Environment
@chapter Environment variables
@cindex Environment variables
@cindex CHESSDIR
Game and position files are found in a directory named by the
@code{CHESSDIR} environment variable. If this variable is not set, the
current working directory is used. If @code{CHESSDIR} is set,
XBoard actually changes its working directory to
@code{$CHESSDIR}, so any files written by the chess engine
will be placed there too.

@node Limitations
@chapter Limitations and known bugs
@cindex Limitations
@cindex Bugs
There is no way for two people running copies of XBoard to play
each other without going through an Internet Chess Server.

Under some circumstances, your ICS password may be echoed when you log on.

If you are connecting to the ICS by running telnet on an Internet
provider or firewall host, you may find that each line you type is
echoed back an extra time after you hit @key{Enter}. If your Internet
provider is a Unix system, you can probably turn its echo off by
typing @kbd{stty -echo} after you log in, and/or typing
@key{^E}@key{Enter} (Ctrl+E followed by the Enter key) to the telnet
program after you have logged into ICS.  It is a good idea to do this
if you can, because the extra echo can occasionally confuse XBoard's
parsing routines.

The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

The internal move legality tester does not look at the game history,
so in some cases it misses illegal castling or en passant captures.
It permits castling with the king on the d file because this is possible in
some "wild 1" games on ICS.  It does not check
piece drops in bughouse and crazyhouse to see if you actually
hold the piece you are trying to drop.
However, if you attempt an illegal move when using
a chess engine or chess server, XBoard will accept the error message
that comes back, undo the move, and let you try another.

Fischer Random castling is not understood.  You can probably play
Fischer Random successfully on ICS by typing castling moves into the ICS
Interaction window, but they will not be animated correctly, and saved
games will not be loaded correctly if castling occurs.

FEN positions saved by XBoard
never include correct information about whether castling is legal or
how many half-moves have been made since the last irreversible move,
and sometimes may not correctly indicate when en passant capture is available.

The mate detector does not understand that non-contact mate is not
really mate in bughouse and crazyhouse.  The only problem this causes
while playing is minor: a @samp{#} (mate indicator) character will show
up after a non-contact mating move in the move list; XBoard will
not assume the game is over at that point.  However, if you are editing
a game, Edit Game mode will be terminated by a non-contact mate.

The menus may not work if your keyboard is in Caps Lock or Num Lock mode.
This seems to be a problem with the Athena menu widget,
not an XBoard bug.

possible bugs, limitations, and ideas for improvement that have been
suggested.

these options to whatever values you prefer by supplying them on
CMail's command line.  @xref{Options}.

@node CMail game
@section Starting a CMail Game
Type @file{cmail} from a shell to start a game as white. After an opening
message, you will be prompted for a game name, which is optional---if you
simply press @key{Enter}, the game name will take the form
@samp{you-VS-opponent}. You will next be prompted for the short name
of your opponent. If you haven't played this person before, you will also
be prompted for his/her email address. @file{cmail} will then invoke
XBoard in the background. Make your first move and select
@samp{Mail Move} from the @samp{File} menu. @xref{File Menu}. If all is well,
@file{cmail} will mail a copy of the move to your opponent. If you select
@samp{Exit} without having selected @samp{Mail Move} then no move will be
made.

@node CMail answer
@section Answering a Move
When you receive a message from an opponent containing a move in one of
your games, simply pipe the message through @file{cmail}. In some mailers
this is as simple as typing @kbd{| cmail} when viewing the message, while in
others you may have to save the message to a file and do @kbd{cmail < file}
at the command line. In either case @file{cmail} will display the game using
XBoard. If you didn't exit XBoard when you made your first move
then @file{cmail} will do its best to use the existing XBoard instead
of starting a new one. As before, simply make a move and select
@samp{Mail Move} from the @samp{File} menu. @xref{File Menu}. @file{cmail}
will try to use the
XBoard that was most recently used to display the current game. This
means that many games can be in progress simultaneously, each with its own
active XBoard.

If you want to look at the history or explore a variation, go ahead, but
you must return to the current position before XBoard will allow you
to mail a move. If you edit the game's history you must select
@samp{Reload Same Game} from the @samp{File} menu to get back to the original
position, then make the move you want and select @samp{Mail Move}.
As before, if you decide you aren't ready to make a move just yet you can
either select @samp{Exit} without sending a move or just leave
XBoard running until you are ready.

@node CMail multi
@section Multi-Game Messages

It is possible to have a @file{cmail} message carry more than one game.
This feature was implemented to handle IECG (International Email Chess
Group) matches, where a match consists of one game as white and one as black,
with moves transmitted simultaneously. In case there are more general uses,
@file{cmail} itself places no limit on the number of black/white games
contained in a message; however, XBoard does.

@node CMail completion
@section Completing a Game
Because XBoard can detect checkmate and stalemate, @file{cmail}
handles game termination sensibly. As well as resignation, the
@samp{Action} menu allows draws to be offered and accepted for
@file{cmail} games.

For multi-game messages, only unfinished and just-finished games will be
included in email messages. When all the games are finished, they are
archived in the user's archive directory, and similarly in the opponent's
when he or she pipes the final message through @file{cmail}. The archive
file name includes the date the game was started.

@node CMail trouble
@section Known CMail Problems
It's possible that a strange conjunction of conditions may occasionally
mean that @file{cmail} has trouble reactivating an existing
XBoard. If this should happen, simply trying it again should work.
If not, remove the file that stores the XBoard's PID
(@file{game.pid}) or use the @samp{-xreuse} option to force
@file{cmail} to start a new XBoard.

Versions of @file{cmail} after 2.16 no longer understand the old file format
that XBoard used to use and so cannot be used to correspond with
anyone using an older version.

Versions of @file{cmail} older than 2.11 do not handle multi-game messages,
so multi-game correspondence is not possible with opponents using an older
version.

@section GNU Chess

The GNU Chess engine is available from:

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuchess/

You can use XBoard to play a game against GNU Chess, or to
interface GNU Chess to an ICS.

@node Crafty
@section Crafty

Crafty is a chess engine written by Bob Hyatt.
You can use XBoard to play a game against Crafty, hook Crafty up
to an ICS, or use Crafty to interactively analyze games and positions
for you.

Crafty is a strong, rapidly evolving chess program. This rapid
pace of development is good, because it means Crafty is always
getting better.  This can sometimes cause problems with
backwards compatibility, but usually the latest version of Crafty
will work well with the latest version of XBoard.
Crafty can be obtained from its author's FTP site:
ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/.

To use Crafty with XBoard, give the -fcp and -fd options as follows, where
<crafty's directory> is the directory in which you installed Crafty
and placed its book and other support files.

@node zic2xpm
@section zic2xpm

The ``zic2xpm'' program is used to import chess sets from the ZIICS(*)
program into XBoard. ``zic2xpm'' is part of the XBoard distribution.
ZIICS is available from:

ftp://ftp.freechess.org/pub/chess/DOS/ziics131.exe

To import ZIICS pieces, do this:
@table @asis
@item 1. Unzip ziics131.exe into a directory:

@example
unzip -L ziics131.exe -d ~/ziics
@end example
@item 2. Use zic2xpm to convert a set of pieces to XBoard format.

For example, let's say you want to use the
FRITZ4 set. These files are named ``fritz4.*'' in the ZIICS distribution.

@example
mkdir ~/fritz4
cd ~/fritz4
zic2xpm ~/ziics/fritz4.*
@end example
@item 3. Give XBoard the ``-pixmap'' option when starting up, e.g.:

@example
xboard -pixmap ~/fritz4
@end example

Alternatively, you can add this line to your .Xdefaults file:

@example
xboard*pixmapDirectory: ~/fritz4
@end example
