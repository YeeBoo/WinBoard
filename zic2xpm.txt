       zziicc22xxppmm converts one or more ZIICS piece files into a format  that  can
       be  used  by XBoard.  If you give more than one filename, be aware that
       multiple sets of the same size cannot exist in one directory.  Multiple
       sets of different sizes can exist in a single directory.

       If  you  wanted  to  make  a  directory  containing  the sets SET2.V32,
       SET2.V40, SET2.V50, and SET2.V56, all of which are located in  ~/ziics,
       you could do:

             mkdir Sets
             cd Sets
             zic2xpm ~/ziics/SET2.*

       You would then run XBoard like this:

            xboard -pixmap Sets
